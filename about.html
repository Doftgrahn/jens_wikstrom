      </h1>

      <p>
        Jens Wikström is a Swedish wildlife photographer, naturalist and expedition leader working in the Polar Regions.
        Since 2011, he has been working
        on ships as a sailor,
        guide and expedition leader, making over 100 expeditions to
        the Arctic and Antarctica.

      </p>

      <p>
        An avid photographer and ornithologist, Jens has travelled extensively around the globe,
         resulting in a passion for remote wilderness areas and
        wildlife conservation. In particular, he is deeply acquainted with the Svalbard Archipelago,
        where he was worked since 2011.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an expedition leader, Jens' vision is to inspire both ship mates and passengers to get involved in nature
        photography and wildlife viewing. When not at sea, he exhibits his photographs in an effort to spread interest
        and awareness about the Polar Regions.
